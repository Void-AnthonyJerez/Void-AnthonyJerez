## Hi there 👋

<p> My name is Anthony Jerez, I'm just a 20 years old guy that is interested in many topics <br>
I have been 1 year studying in ITLA, so I will use Github for ITLA Assignments or any crazy idea my crazy head could have</p>
<br>
<p>Right Now, I'm learning C# and SQL, I cannot say that I am a pro and probably i'll never be able to said that since the process of learning is constant <br>
I'm still a begginer clearly. Therefore, there are many topics and aspects i need to learn.</p>
